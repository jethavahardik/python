The day a student goes to school for the first time is called first day at school. My first day at school is a memorable day for me. It is a red-letter day for me. When my parents declared the news of my schooling, I became very much excited and started leaping and dancing in great joy. Then the expected day came. I went to every member of our family and received blessings from all. I was in a very happy and cheerful mood. I went to school for the first time when I was only seven years old. My father took me to school for the first time. I was little nervous at the beginning. I remember it well. I was then a little boy. I was very interested in going to school with riding rickshaw accompanied by my father. First I met with Headmaster at school. My heart beat fast. But this smiling face and gentle words put me at ease.  He asked me my name. I answered politely. The headmaster was very pleased with my response. When I was sent to class. My class teacher took me to the classroom and introduced to my classmates. I met with the teachers and students who behaved well with me. My classmates were very much friendly and soon they accepted me as one of their bosom friend. They received me very cordially and made friendship with me, within a short time. The school broke up at 2 pm. My father again came and took me home. I left the school with a cheerful mind. That day was very remarkable in my life.
